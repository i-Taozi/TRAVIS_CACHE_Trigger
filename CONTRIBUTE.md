# How to contribute to Java::Geci

The simplest way to contribute it is to start using it.

The next step is to drop a mail, github ticket just reporting that you are using it.
If you describe your way of use the better.
The more information you provide for the developers and other users the more knowledge we all gain.
That way you help the developers to understand better the type of use of the tool that is really needed and is utilized.
The other users can get some ideas about how to use the tool.

You can ask for and suggest features, bug fixes in github tickets.
We will consider every suggestion.
If you find a solution fixing a bug you can fork the project and create a pull request (PR) along with the github ticket.
If you need any extra functionality that you think could be incorporated into the project then, again: for it, make the change and create a PR.

If you just have any idea you want to develop:

    FMPR: fork --> modify --> pull request

When creating pull request, we recommend to follow the guidelines related to pull requests in the [OpenRegime](https://github.com/verhas/openregime) documents.

You are more than welcome to write unit tests for code segments that are not 100% covered, and the same is true for JavaDoc and any other documentation.
Is there any language issues? `FMPR`!
Something could be explained in more detail? `FMPR`!

ANY FEEDBACK IS WELCOME
