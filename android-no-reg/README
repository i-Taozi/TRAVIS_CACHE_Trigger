This directory contains is a dummy library app project and is used to ensure the
code is compatible with Android (eg: that we don't use an API not available on
Android).

To use it, on a laptop where the Android environment is setup, just `cd` into this
directory, and run

    ./test.sh

Tests are run locally so it may not be completely error proof, but it already makes
catches potential issues (eg: using javax.xml.bind in the code)
