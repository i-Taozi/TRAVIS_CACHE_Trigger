# The Name of Java:Geci

The name of Java::Geci stands for GEnerate Code Inline.
This is the official and only explanation for the meaning.
When referenced in code, like using as a module name we spell it as one word `javageci`.
In other environment where the reference to the framework allow mixed case and punctuation characters then we spell it as `Java::Geci`.

It shows the coffee bean with the crack in the middle.
The crack is shaping a male gamete.
With this interpretation the bean, representing Java is the female gamete into which the male gamete is injected thus fertilizing it.
This symbolizes the injected code (the male gamete) into Java (the bean, female gamete).

At the same time the “male gamete” synonyms and expressions in English just as well as in other languages can also have different connotations.
Many times these words or expressions have a rude meaning.
This was also taken into account when selecting the name and the symbol of the application.
Generating code is a double-edged sword.
It is extremely powerful automating tasks that could only be done manually with cumbersome work without code generation, but it has to be used in programming as a last resort only.
Creating a tool that makes it easy to generate code may lead to projects that use code generation in situations where they are not supposed to.
Some lazy developers may generate code instead of utilizing the already available features of the programming language.
Thus Java::Geci can be a blessing but the same time it can also be a curse.
